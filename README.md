### Project Abstract:
The repository is for TFA project. The project is about processing a dataset to solve problems. The dataset consists of calls to the 311 phone number for non-emergency services, which contains 2587316 entries and 41 columns. For our analysis, we picked 10033 as the target zip code. 

In the first Jupyter notebook called Top10.ipynb, we analyzed what the top 10 causes of calls to 311 are in 10033, and calculated how many total incidents of each of these 10 types there have been in the year 2020. In the second Jupyter notebook called Parking.ipynb, we analyzed whether illegal parking incidents are a larger fraction of total 311 incidents in 10033 than they are in general.
